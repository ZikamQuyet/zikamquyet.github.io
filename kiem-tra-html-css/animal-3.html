            A mouse, plural mice, is a small mammal. Characteristically, mice
            are known to have a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length
            scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species
            is the common house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice are also popular as
            pets. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally
            common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Mice
            are typically distinguished from rats by their size. Generally, when
            a muroid rodent is discovered, its common name includes the term
            mouse if it is smaller, or rat if it is larger. The common terms rat
            and mouse are not taxonomically specific.
