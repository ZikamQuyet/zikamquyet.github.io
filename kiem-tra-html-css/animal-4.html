            The dog or domestic dog, (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus
            familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is
            characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient,
            extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest
            living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be
            domesticated,[9][8] by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7]
            before the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long
            association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
            domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a
            starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[11] Over
            the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and
            the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[12]
